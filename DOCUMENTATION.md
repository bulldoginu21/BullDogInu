Documentation is hosted at https://docs.BullDogInu.com/contracts.

All of the content for the site is in this repository. The guides are in the
[docs](/docs) directory, and the API Reference is extracted from comments in
the source code. If you want to help improve the content, this is the
repository you should be contributing to.

[`solidity-docgen`](https://github.com/bulldoginu21/BullDogInu/solidity-docgen) is the
program that extracts the API Reference from source code.

The [`docs.BullDogInu.com`](https://github.com/bulldoginu21/BullDogInu/docs.BullDogInu.com)
repository hosts the configuration for the entire site, which includes
documentation for all of the BullDogInu projects.

To run the docs locally you should run `npm run docs:watch` on this
repository.
